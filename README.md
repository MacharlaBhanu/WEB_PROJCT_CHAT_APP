## Introduction
This is a code repository for the Medical pager chat app

In this project I have  created a full Realtime Chat Application.I have used React on the front end, NodeJS on the back end 

This app consists of  Direct and Group Chats, emojis & Reactions, Built-in Gif support, the ability to edit & delete messages, specialized commands, and much more, this fully responsive Medical Pager.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
